The solution uses the `docChanges()` method to handle changes to the documents in the collection and access the data only when a document is added.

```javascript
db.collection('myCollection').onSnapshot((snapshot) => {
  snapshot.docChanges().forEach(change => {
    if (change.type === 'added') {
      console.log(change.doc.data().myField); //Safe to access after the document is added
    }
  });
});
```
This ensures that you access `myField` only when it is guaranteed to exist, preventing errors caused by premature data access.
